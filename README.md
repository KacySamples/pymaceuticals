Analysis:

The study involved data from a total of 249 mice. Duplicate data for some mice was identified and removed.

The data included observations of tumor volume, metastatic sites, sex, age, weight, and drug regimens.

The data helped reveal the effectiveness of different types of drugs in reducing tumor volume over a 45 day span. 

Capomulin was the most used drug type. 
Propriva was the least used.

Capomulin was the most promising in reducing tumor volume. 

Outliers were identified for Infubinol.

A scatter plot was generated to examine the relationship between mouse weight and the average observed tumor volume for Capomulin.

The analysis indicates that Capomulin was the most effective in reducing tumor volume.
